Setting up fullchem.eqn to work with the box model, version 14
1) set macro in ~/.vimrc: let @r = ":s/\:.*/: R\<cr>‚Äù
2) go to line 525 in fullchem.eqn, and execute first macro @r
3) edit the R after the semi colon to be R(13)
4) start recording a macro qm<keywords>q: this macro is not easily defined in .vimrc, but was recorded in my ~/.vimfinfo as 
"m      CHAR    0
        @r?:^Mnf(ya(/:^MfRp?:^Mf(^A/:^M
|3,0,22,0,1,0,1680461544,"@r?:^Mnf(ya(/:^MfRp?:^Mf(^A/:^M"    
4) go to line 526 and type 900@m
5) hard code the last line: R(913)
